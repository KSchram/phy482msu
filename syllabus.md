### Overview

Physics 482, Electricity and Magnetism 2, is the second semester of our
two-semester sequence of junior-level classical electromagnetism. I

#### Required purchases:

1.  J.D. Griffiths. [*Introduction to Electromagnetism*, 4th
    Edition](http://goo.gl/iU6MdA) (Pearson; 2012). This book is
    pedagogically excellent and is my favorite undergrad textbook of
    them all! There are [other editions that might be less
    expensive](http://goo.gl/78y9jw), and they can be substituted. But
    reading assignments will come from the 4th edition, which may have
    some different content.
2.  An "iClicker", available at the bookstore, will be used
    every lecture.

### Course Activities

#### Readings

Reading is an essential part of 482! Reading the text before class is
very important. Lecture is to clarify your understanding, to help you
make sense of the material. I will assume you have done the required
readings in advance! Griffiths is one of the best (and most readable)
texts I know of - it will make a huge difference if you spend the time
and effort to carefully read and follow the text. The
[calendar](./calendar.html) has the details on reading assignments.

#### Class Meetings

Classroom Etiquette: Please turn off all cell phones and pagers when
entering any classroom. Please do not throw vegetables at the
instructor. Private chatter during lecture is very distracting, but it
is perfectly OK to interrupt the lecture by yelling "Question!"
Questions in lecture are always good, and are strongly encouraged!

#### Homework

There will be a homework due every Friday at the start of class. Late
homework can't be accepted once solutions are posted - but, your lowest
score will be dropped. Homework is exceedingly important for developing
an understanding of the course material, not to mention building skills
in complex physical and mathematical problem solving. They will require
considerable time and personal effort this term!

*I strongly encourage collaboration*, an essential skill in science and
engineering (and highly valued by employers!) Social interactions are
critical to scientists' success -- most good ideas grow out of
discussions with colleagues, and essentially all physicists work as part
of a group. Find partners and work on homework together. However, it is
also important that you OWN the material. I strongly suggest you start
homework by yourself (and that means really making an extended effort on
every problem). Then work with a group, and finally, finish up on your
own -- write up your own work, in your own way. There will also be time
for peer discussion during classes -- as you work together, try to help
your partners get over confusions, listen to them, ask each other
questions, critique, teach each other. You will learn a lot this way!
Note: While collaboration is the rule in technical work, evaluations of
individuals also play an important role. Exams will be done without help
from others. For all assignments, the work you turn in must in the end
be your own: in your own words, reflecting your own understanding. (If,
at any time, for any reason, you feel disadvantaged or isolated, contact
me and I can discretely try to help arrange study groups.)

**Computational Homework Problems:** There will be *some use of computation in this course* on homework problems. I will encourage and support the use of Python (through [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)). You do not need any computational experience for this course as you will learn some fundamentals early on and keep using them throughout the course. You are welcome to use any environment of your choosing (e.g., Octave/MATLAB, Mathematica, C++), but I will only provide support for Python. Python is in use across the sciences, but it is becoming much used in physics, so learning it will serve you well in
your future work. I suggest downloading the [Anaconda distribution of
Python](https://www.continuum.io/) as it comes with all the packages you
will need to get up and running with Jupyter notebooks.

**[Installing Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)**

#### Help Sessions

(Times listed at the top of the syllabus) Help sessions/office hours are to facilitate your learning. We encourage attendance - plan on working in small groups, our role will be as learning coaches. Both sessions are homework-centric, but we will not be explicitly telling anyone how to do the homework (how would that help you learn?) I strongly encourage you to start all problems on your own. If you come to help sessions "cold", the value of homework to you will be greatly reduced.

### Grading and Exams


### What we cover, and why:


### Comments on preparation:

Physics 482 covers material you might have seen before (Many of the topics
stem from PHY 184/294H material) but at a higher level of conceptual and
mathematical sophistication.

Therefore you should expect:

-   a large amount of material covered quickly.
-   no recitations, and few examples covered in lecture. Most homework
    problems are not similar to examples from class.
-   long, hard homework problems that usually cannot be completed by one
    individual alone.
-   challenging exams.

Physics 482 is a challenging, upper‐division physics course. Unlike more
introductory courses, you are fully responsible for your own learning.
In particular, you control the pace of the course by asking questions in
class. I tend to speak quickly, and questions are important to slow down
the lecture. This means that if you don't understand something, it is
your responsibility to ask questions. Attending class and the homework
help sessions gives you an opportunity to ask questions. I am here to
help you as much as possible, but I need your questions to know what you
don't understand.

Physics 482 covers some of the most important physics and mathematical
methods in the field. Your reward for the hard work and effort will be
learning important and elegant material that you will use over and over
as a physics major. Here is what I have experienced, and heard from
other faculty teaching upper division physics in the past:

- most students reported spending a minimum of 10 hours per week on the
homework (!!)
- students who didn't attend the homework help sessions
often did poorly in the class.
- students reported learning a tremendous amount in this class.

**The course topics that we will cover in Physics 481 are among the
greatest intellectual achievements of humans. Don't be surprised if you
have to think hard and work hard to master the material.**

### Handling Emergency Situations

*In the event of an emergency arising within the classroom, Prof. Caballero will notify you of what actions that may be required to ensure your safety. It is the responsibility of each student to understand the evacuation, “shelter-in-place,” and “secure-in-place” guidelines posted in each facility and to act in a safe manner. You are allowed to maintain cellular devices in a silent mode during this course, in order to receive emergency SMS text, phone or email messages distributed by the university. When anyone receives such a notification or observes an emergency situation, they should immediately bring it to the attention of Prof. Caballero in a way that causes the least disruption. If an evacuation is ordered, please ensure that you do it in a safe manner and facilitate those around you that may not otherwise be able to safely leave. When these orders are given, you do have the right as a member of this community to follow that order. Also, if a shelter-in-place or secure-in-place is ordered, please seek areas of refuge that are safe depending on the emergency encountered and provide assistance if it is advisable to do so.*
