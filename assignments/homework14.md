## Self-Reflect (PHY 481 and 482)

We've talked about a lot of different things in E&M 1 and 2. In doing so, we've covered Chapters 1-9 and 12 of Griffiths along with a bunch of other special topics. You've studied systems on your own and learned a ton of E&M. Think about where your E&M knowledge was at the beginning of last fall and where it is now.

1. Write up a half-page or so about how you feel your understanding of E&M has changed. Think about what you enjoyed learning most, what you felt you learned most deeply, and what you think that means for you in your future as a physicist.
2. On the first day of class in PHY 481, I asked you to draw a concept map of E&M. How different concepts were connected and why they were connected that way. Draw another one now. Think about all the new knowledge you have gained and how it all fits together. Focus on the high level concepts and ideas and fill in as much detail as you feel you need to make your point.
