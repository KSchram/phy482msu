# Homework 1 (Due. Jan 16)

## 1. Sketching

1. Make a quick sketch, in the x-y plane, of the following (two-dimensional) vector function.
Plot enough different vectors to give a feeling for what this field looks like in the x-y plane.
2. Explain briefly in words what this plot is showing. (Is it physically realizable?)
3. Do the same as above for the field  
(Here, I am assuming we are in 3-D spherical coordinates, but there is no azimuthal dependence. How should you "sketch" this?) (Where have you seen this field before?)
