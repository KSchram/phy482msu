# Homework 1 (Due. Jan 16)

## 1. Sketching
Make a quick sketch, in the x-y plane, of the following (two-dimensional) vector function.
Plot enough different vectors to give a feeling for what this field looks like in the x-y plane.
 (a)  
Explain briefly in words what this plot is showing. (Is it physically realizable?)

















Optional, Extra credit (try it when you’re done with the rest of the homework)
Do the same as above for the field  
(Here, I am assuming we are in 3-D spherical coordinates, but there is no azimuthal dependence. How should you “sketch” this?)
(Where have you seen this field before?)
