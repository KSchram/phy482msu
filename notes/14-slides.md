Ampere's Law relates the line integral of B around some closed path, to a current flowing through a surface bounded by the chosen closed path.

$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} =  \mu_0 I$

By calling it a "Law", we expect that:

1. It is neither correct nor useful.
2. It is sometimes correct and sometimes easy to use.
3. It is correct and sometimes easy to use.
4. It is correct and always easy to use.
5. None of the above.

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

3. Gaussâ€™ law!
4. ???

The complete differential form of Ampere's Law is now argued to be:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

The integral form of this equation is:

1. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
2. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
3. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
4. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
