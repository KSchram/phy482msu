Consider a large parallel plate capacitor as shown, charging so that $Q = Q_0+\beta t$ on the positively charged plate. Assuming the edges of the capacitor and the wire connections to the plates can be ignored, what is the direction of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ halfway between the plates, at a radius $r$?

Same capacitor with $Q = Q_0+\beta t$ on the positively charged plate. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ halfway between the plates, at a radius $r$?

<img src="./images/charging_cap_dEdt_smaller.png" align="left" style="width: 400px";/>

1. $\frac{\mu_0 \beta}{2 \pi r}$
2. $\frac{\mu_0 \beta r}{2 d^2}$
3. $\frac{\mu_0 \beta d}{2 a^2}$
4. $\frac{\mu_0 \beta a}{2 \pi r^2}$
5. None of the above

Note:
* Correct Answer: E

Consider the surface of an imaginary volume (dashed lines, at right) that partly encloses the left capacitor plate. For this closed surface, is the total flux of the current density, $\iint \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ positive, negative or zero?



1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Zero

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* The charge density is increasing, so the total charge in the region is increasing with time, thus the flux of the current density must be negative (conservation of charge).

At each location, we will evaluate the sign of $\partial \rho/\partial t$ and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$.

At location 1, the signs of $\partial \rho/\partial t$ and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ are:
1. both zero
2. both negative
3. both positive
4. $\partial \rho/\partial t$ is positive and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ is negative
5. $\partial \rho/\partial t$ is negative and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ is positive

*Recall that charge is conserved locally!*
