$\mathcal{E} = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$

EMF ($\mathcal{E}$) is the line integral of the total force per unit charge around a closed loop.
The units of EMF are:   

1. Farads
2. Joules
3. Amps, (that’s why current flows.)
4. Newtons, (that’s why it’s called emf)
5. Volts

Note:
* Correct Answer: E

Imagine a charge $q$ able to move around a tube which makes a closed loop. If we want to drive the charge around the loop, we **cannot** do this with E-field from a single stationary charge.

Can we drive the charge around the loop with some combination of stationary + and – charges?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

A rectangular metal loop moves through a region of constant uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, with speed $v$ at $t = 0$, as shown.  What is the magnetic force on the loop at the instant shown? Assume the loop has resistance $R$.

<img src="./images/loop_in_Bfield.png" align="left" style="width: 500px";/>

1. $2L^2 vB^2/R$ (right)
2. $2L^2 vB^2/R$  (left)
3. 0           
4. Something else/not sure...

Consider two situations:<br/>

1) Loop moves to right with speed $\lvert v\rvert$<br/>

2) Magnet moves to left with (same) speed $\lvert v\rvert$<br/>

<img src="./images/loop_in_Bfield_ammeter.png" align="left" style="width: 500px";/>

What will the ammeter read in each case? (Assume that CCW current => positive ammeter reading)

1. $I_1$>0, $I_2$=0
2. $I_1$= $I_2$ > 0
3. $I_1$= -$I_2$ > 0
4. $I_1$= $I_2$ = 0
5. Something different/not sure

Faraday found that EMF is proportional to the negative time rate of change of B. EMF is also the line integral of a **force/charge**. The force is $\mathbf{f}_q$ in the expression:

$$\mathcal{E} = \oint \mathbf{f}_q \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

That force is:

1. the magnetic Lorentz force.
2. an electric force.
3. the strong nuclear force.
4. the gravitational force.
5. an entirely new force.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B, but there's a subtlety here; could E (special relativity)
