For the RL circuit with driving voltage of $V(t) = V_0 \cos (\omega t)$, we found a solution for the current as a function of time, with $I=0$ at $t=0$,

$$I(t) = a \cos(\omega t + \phi) - a\cos(\phi) e^{-Rt/L}$$

where $a = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2+L^2\omega^2}}$ and $\phi = \tan^{-1}(-L\omega/R)$. What happens to the current when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$?

1. Current is essentially zero, for all time
2. Current dies off completely, eventually goes to zero
3. Eventually, current is constant, $V_0/R$
4. It depends
5. ???
